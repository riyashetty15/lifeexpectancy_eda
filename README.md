# Data Analysis of Life Expectancy using R
The aim of this Mini Project is to understand and learn about life expectancy and its relationship to GDP per capita. For this, I have made use of the package gapminder which for each of 142 countries, over 5 continents, provides values for life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population, for a particular number of years, from 1952 to 2007.
